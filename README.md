I use i3wm with nitrogen to handle my wallpapers. I change my wallpapers constantly so I made a script that made it easier to go through all my wallpapers and change them.
Currently it is only personal as it uses absolute paths to folders on my computer so if someone else wanted to use it, it would have to be modified.

Program is built in Go.
